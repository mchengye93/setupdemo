Steps to starting a new project:
1) Initialize the folder for the project and for github
    - Start folder npm init (git init to start tracking stuff for github)
2) Install dependencies
3) Setup compile/bundling technology
4) Plan the application:
    a) Make a desired feature list (brainstorm if from scratch, derive from instruction if not)
    b) Think about different user stories and edit/add/remove features
    c) Make a wireframe/diagram of the UI
    d) Make a schema for my database to store all data necessary to support final feature list
    e) Plan RESTful API to support all the features
    f) Make a data-flow diagram for each of the routes
    g) Possibly make a data-flow diagram for each complete feature
    h) Break my wireframe diagram down into React components and diagram with state and method passing
    i) Stub out the API routes from step e) and create database controller methods to get information needed by each route.
